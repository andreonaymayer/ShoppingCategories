# ShoppingCategories

This project is the beginning of my activities in the Shopping TownSq team.

A CRUD will be implemented using SpringBoot, for the Categories table.

The table will include the primary key and category name.

Also:

- Create unit tests.
- Implement API authentication
- Deploy on Docker
